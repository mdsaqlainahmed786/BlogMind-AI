You can get hand's on expreince testing this project by visiting the vercel URL. Or maybe I'll just upload the tutorial video for this....

I've already mentioned in the website, but here is the thing.
while making a payment use
1) This demo domestic card for payments: 4718 6091 0820 4366 1111, (Do not use real card, and I know you wont)
2) Use 4 digit random number otp(Not while verifying the email, only during payemnt)
3) If mobile number is asked then use a random 10 digit phone number ( Do not use your actual phone number)

If you see any bugs or something error then raise a issue.
